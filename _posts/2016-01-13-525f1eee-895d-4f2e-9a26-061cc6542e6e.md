Welcome to Acacia Montessori School

We believe that the key to changing the world is through the hearts of the children. At Acacia Montessori we are dedicated to giving families and children the support and high quality program for them to thrive. Our programs integrate Maria Montessori's philosophy with the elements of child development to create an enriching curriculum and exciting learning environment. We offer a flexible program to help children in their learning processes and prepare them for their future through independent exploration and freedom of choice. Each child's unique needs, natural abilities and desire to learn are focused upon to provide them with an age-appropriate education. Children are encouraged by teachers and peers to progress at their own pace and share enriching experiences. Our program is equipped and staffed to provide wholesome quality care for children toddlers and up.
